*I've since removed this from the Chrome Store. [Duolingo redesigned skill trees in 2018](https://making.duolingo.com/crown-levels-a-royal-redesign) which removed the "decay" concept that the extension was searching for.*

DuoScroll is a small Chrome extension that adds a button to your toolbar which scrolls to the next active lesson in your Duolingo tree.
